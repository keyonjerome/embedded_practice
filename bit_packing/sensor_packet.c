    // In C, when you use a signed type like int16_t in an expression, it is first *promoted* to int (typically 32-bit).
    // If the original value is negative (e.g., -1), promotion extends the sign bit (e.g., 0xFFFF becomes 0xFFFFFFFF).
    //
    // Then, casting that to uint32_t *does not change the bits*. You now have 0xFFFFFFFF in a 32-bit unsigned value.
    //
    // If you then try to mask or truncate it back to 12 bits (e.g., & 0x0FFF), you've already lost the original pattern,
    // what you wanted was just the low 12 bits of the original two's complement value.
    //
    // âœ… The correct solution is to cast to uint16_t *before* promoting:
    // This ensures you're working with the raw bit pattern (e.g., 0x0FFF for -1) before widening to 32-bit.
    // this got me badly; i had a worse explanation here, and used genai to improve it
